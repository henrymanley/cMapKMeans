# cMapKMeans
### By Henry Manley
Given a list of statements, number of participants, and participant demographics, cMapKMeans auto-generates a Concept Mapping xlsx to be passed into the cMAP R
library. The returned data set is titled "sortData.xlsx", which is defined by parameters set in "globals.py" and user-generated statements made in "statements.xlsx".


## The Procedure
<ul>
<li> Perform KMeans clustering on statements for each participant
<li> Map cluster assignment to each statement
<li> Iterate through participants and generate master sort data
<li> Reshape and clean the data for cMAP
</ul>

## Set Up
After cloning the repo and opening the respective directory, in the command line, paste: `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Then paste `python autoSort.py` to run the program. Open "sortData.xlsx" to find auto-generated sort data as specified by "globals.py". Change "globals.py" file to change the sort of the statements in "statements.xlsx".

## How to Use
Open and edit "globals.py" to include the following parameters:


`participants` Number of participants providing statements. (eg. 5)<br/>
`maxClusters` Maximum number of piles one could sort statements into. (eg. 10)<br/>
`rating1` First rating item for each statement (eg. "Feasibility")<br/>
`rating2` Second rating item for each statement (eg. "Importance")<br/>
`rateMax` Rating scale for each item [1..rateMax] (eg. 5)<br/>

Open and edit "statements.xlsx" to include the statements you want sorted. Each sheet must be named by stakeholder,
and only contain statements generated by such stakeholders.
